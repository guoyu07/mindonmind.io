<p>9月9号，纽约时报焦虑专栏发表了一篇名为「On Being Nothins」的散文。文中，作者 <a href="http://www.brianjaystanley.com/aphorisms/">Brian Jay Stanley</a> 夹叙夹议，讲述了自己从渴望得到关注，到无法得到关注而导致压抑与痛苦，再到接受现实，成为这个世界的关注者的艰难历程。文章极具启发性，下面为其最后两段，也是个人认为最精彩的部分。</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Society is adroid at disillusioning newcomers, and many self-assured children grow up to be bitter adults. But bitterness, instead of a form of disillusionment, is really the refusal to give up your childhood illusions of importance. Ignored instead of welcomed by the world, you fault the world as blind and evil in order not to fault yourself as naive. Bitterness is a child’s coddling narcissism within the context of an adult’s harsh life. Instead, I know that the world only tramples me as a street crowd does an earthworm - not out of malice or stupidity, but because no one sees it. Thus my pain is not to feel wrongly slighted, but to feel rightly slighted.</p>
<p>There must be a Copernical revolution of the self. Instead of pointlessly cursing the sun to go around me, my chance of contentment is learning to orbit, being the world’s audience instead of demanding the world to be mine. If the world is a stage, then everyone’s an extra, acting minor roles in simutaneous scenes in which no one has the lead. With so much happening, society is poorly made to satisfy pride, but well made to stisfy intrest. If we will only let go of our vanity and join the swirl of activity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>大概是好久没读到过这么喜欢的散文了，读完之后思绪万千，并写了一篇读后感如下，顺便充当了四天的写作作业 :-)</p>
<h2 id="forgive-this-world">Forgive This World</h2>
<p>At times, I’m confused by this world, by how it could be so cruel and relentless, apathetically watching me suffering from those overwhelming, unbearable negative emotions. Why couldn’t it listen to me a little bit, and take my sorrow and regret and shame carefully. No matter how I beg or curse, the course has never changed - I have to swallow all my pain and digest it even more painfully. The only good thing is that in the end, I’ll definitely recover and accidentally become stronger. So I think, pain itself may be not so bad.</p>
<p>The author began this article with his habit which may be shared by many other people: checking mailbox with excitement. This habit is carried from his camp years, but its meaning has changed significantly. Mails used to be placebos that assured the author that he was not forgotten by this world, but now those mails only add to his depression.</p>
<p>The cause behind this transition is that the aims of these mails have changed. There are no warm greetings any more, nor lovely concerns. But only requests for money, attention, and taxes, etc. This makes the author feel that he is nothing but “a pawn of others’ projects”. Nevertheless, the author didn’t blame other people for their demands upon him, for himself is just like others, selfish, desirous, and avid, of whom made up this cruel world.</p>
<p>The author further analyzed people’s craving for other people’s notice and recognition. This desire seems to be attached to ourselves since we were born and won’t ever be detached unless we are dead.</p>
<p>The popularity of contemporary social websites or applications is a perfect demonstration. No matter it’s that we find something interesting, or that we attain success, or that we screwed up, rises in our mind or heart a strong tendency to disclose ourselves to other people, along with the wispy hope that we could be applauded, understood, or just responded by them. It seems that we are partial feedback systems eager for other people’s response to make ourselves intact.</p>
<p>But rationally speaking, this kind of desire actually makes little difference. After all, we are what we see, what we think, what we do, all by the hand of our own minds. Unless our minds are born to be inadequate, and outside forces helping confirm their existence are just like daily necessities.</p>
<p>When we were young, these necessities were easy to obtain. We get them from our parents, teachers and peers. That made us feel that we were the center of this world, in which every action of ours were noticed by other people.</p>
<p>But the good old days soon passed away. When we went to college, we were soon disappointed by the grim reality - that we lost our audience. No matter how many friends we made, how many parties we went, we couldn’t run away from the fact that we actually became more and more introvert. Be cared about by others seemed a impossible dream, not to say be truly understood. I remember walking along the cold lonely campus road, hoping someone willing to listen to me. But there were nobody but the trees, to which I whispered so many my thoughts and emotions. What hurt me was not there seemed no one could understand me, but they didn’t bother to. What I thought and felt was just not worthy to make a fuss of. I felt totally ignored by the world. To avoid admitting that I was insignificant, I began to blame the outside world for its coldness and cruelty.</p>
<p>Unable to seek attention from the outside of the world, we often in turn to seek from the opposite direction. It’s not rare to see many people going through things related to themselves over and over again. We childishly think that by doing this we could fill in the vacancy of attention. Nevertheless, no matter where the attention comes from, the desire for more attention could hardly be satisfied.</p>
<p>This world gives no more attention upon us than upon a leaf or cat. That doesn’t mean the world is evil, it’s our naiveness to take for granted that we should be more important than a leaf or cat. To live peacefully, we have to accept the fact that actually, we are nothing more than an ordinary element of the universe, just like every other living or lifeless substance. And to accept the fact, We have to overcome the coddling narcissism rooted in our mind since we were children. There’s no such thing as good or bad, everything just happens, evolves, comes to an end, and then happens again.</p>
<p>This world may be cruel for people who are hard-wired to seek for attention, but it’s what it ought to be. To survive with contentment, the best we can do may be forgiving this world, for its parsimony of attention, and then, forgive ourselves, for born to crave this untouchable thing.</p>
